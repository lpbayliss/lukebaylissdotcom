A real-time analytics dashboard that visualizes trading data with sub-second latency. Built for traders who need instant insight into market movements.

## Technical Overview

**Real-time Data Streaming**
- WebSocket connection with automatic reconnection and backoff
- Message queuing to handle bursts without overwhelming the UI
- Binary protocol (MessagePack) for efficient data transfer

**Visualization**
- Custom D3.js charts optimized for frequent updates
- Canvas rendering for high-frequency data (10+ updates/second)
- SVG for interactive elements and annotations

**State Management**
- Zustand for lightweight global state
- Immer for immutable updates without boilerplate
- React Query for server state caching

## Performance Optimizations

The dashboard needed to handle thousands of data points updating multiple times per second without freezing the UI.

**Virtual Scrolling**: Only render visible rows in tables. For a 10,000-row dataset, render ~50 rows at a time based on scroll position.

**Canvas over SVG**: D3 typically uses SVG, but for rapidly updating charts, canvas is 10x faster. We use canvas for the core visualization and SVG for legends and axes.

**Web Workers**: Heavy calculations (moving averages, standard deviations) run in background threads to keep the main thread responsive.

**Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo prevent unnecessary re-renders. Critical when components receive new props on every data tick.

## Challenges

**Time Synchronization**: Client clocks drift. We sync with server time on connect and adjust all timestamps accordingly.

**Memory Leaks**: Real-time apps accumulate data fast. We cap history at 5 minutes of data and prune old entries aggressively.

**Connection Drops**: Networks fail. The dashboard detects disconnections, shows a warning banner, and replays missed data after reconnection.

## Results

The dashboard cut decision-making time for traders by 60%. Previously, they refreshed pages manually every few seconds. Now, data updates live, and they react instantly to market changes.

Chart rendering performance improved from ~200ms per update to ~16ms (60 FPS) after switching to canvas and optimizing re-renders.
