The goal of this build is to create a dependable home for writing, projects, and a résumé-quality profile.

Key objectives:

- Static-first architecture deployed globally on Fly.io.
- MDX-powered content collections for writing and project briefs.
- ASCII-driven styling cues to match the retro terminal mood.

Work in progress highlights:

1. Global layout featuring an accessible navigation bar and skip links.
2. Markdown-first editorial workflow with schema validation.
3. Containerized deployment flow with a Fly launch configuration.

Future iterations will add automation for RSS feeds, analytics via Umami, and dynamic Open Graph images.
