A unified CLI for managing multi-cloud infrastructure, replacing a patchwork of bash scripts and manual processes.

## Why Go?

The previous tooling was a mess of bash scripts, Python utilities, and manual AWS console clicking. We needed something:
- **Fast**: Developers wait for nothing. Sub-second startup time was non-negotiable.
- **Portable**: A single binary that works on Linux, macOS, and Windows without dependencies.
- **Maintainable**: Bash is great until it's not. Go's type system prevents entire classes of bugs.

## Core Features

**Infrastructure Provisioning**
```bash
devops infra create --env staging --region us-west-2
```
Spins up VPC, subnets, load balancers, and ECS clusters using Terraform modules under the hood.

**Deployment Management**
```bash
devops deploy --service api --env production --version v2.3.1
```
Blue-green deployments with automatic rollback on health check failures.

**Environment Configuration**
```bash
devops config set DATABASE_URL postgres://... --env staging
```
Encrypted secret storage in AWS Secrets Manager with local caching for faster access.

**Logs and Debugging**
```bash
devops logs --service api --env production --tail
```
Streams CloudWatch logs with filtering and colorized output.

## Design Principles

**Idempotent Commands**: Running the same command twice produces the same result. No "already exists" errors.

**Fail Fast with Clear Errors**: If AWS credentials are missing, say so immediately. No cryptic stack traces.

**Progress Feedback**: Long-running operations show progress bars and estimated time remaining.

**Offline Mode**: Common commands (listing resources, viewing configs) use cached data when the network is unavailable.

## Adoption

Within three months of release:
- 40+ developers use it daily
- Deployment time reduced from 15 minutes to 3 minutes
- Configuration drift eliminated (everything is version-controlled and applied via CLI)
- Onboarding time for new engineers cut in half (clear commands vs. tribal knowledge)

## Future Plans

- Add drift detection to alert when manual AWS console changes bypass the CLI
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments
- Add a TUI (text-based UI) for interactive workflows
