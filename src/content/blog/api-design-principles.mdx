Good API design is one of those things that seems simple until you're knee-deep in versioning conflicts and breaking changes. Here are the principles I keep coming back to.

## Consistency is King

The fastest way to frustrate API consumers is inconsistency. If one endpoint returns errors as `{ error: "message" }` and another uses `{ message: "error" }`, you've just created cognitive overhead.

Pick conventions and stick to them:
- Error response structure
- Date formatting (ISO 8601, always)
- Pagination patterns
- Naming schemes for endpoints

## Design for the Consumer

Your API isn't for you—it's for the developers who will integrate with it. This means:

**Use intuitive resource names.** `/users` not `/get-all-users-from-database`. REST endpoints should represent resources, not actions.

**Return what they need.** If most consumers only need a subset of fields, consider partial responses via field selection (`?fields=id,name,email`).

**Think about the happy path and the error path.** A 500 error with no context is a dead end. Return actionable error messages with enough detail to debug but not so much that you leak internals.

## Versioning from Day One

You will make breaking changes. Accept it and plan for it.

The common approaches:
- **URL versioning**: `/v1/users`, `/v2/users`
- **Header versioning**: `Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=1`
- **Query parameter**: `/users?version=1`

I prefer URL versioning because it's explicit and easy to cache. Whatever you choose, document your deprecation policy upfront.

## Pagination and Rate Limiting

If your endpoint can return more than 100 items, it needs pagination. Cursor-based pagination is generally better than offset-based for large datasets, but offset is simpler for smaller ones.

Rate limiting protects your infrastructure and sets expectations. Return rate limit info in headers:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

## Document with Examples

Nobody reads reference docs cover-to-cover. They scan for examples.

Show request bodies, response bodies, and common error scenarios. Tools like OpenAPI/Swagger help, but don't let generated docs replace human-written guides.

## Final Thoughts

APIs are contracts. Breaking them destroys trust. Design with empathy, version ruthlessly, and document relentlessly. Your future self (and your users) will thank you.
