> Systems are best when they are obvious, legible, and calm.

This space gathers writing about engineering leadership, infrastructure, and the occasional experiment. Expect concise notes, longer-form essays, and references to tools I rely on.

- Architecting calm platforms.
- Building teams that ship sustainably.
- Exploring how to document intent as clearly as code.

Thanks for dropping by. RSS is coming soon; until then, take a look around.
