          I've had an interesting and varied journey in my career so far. I spent time working on integration systems
          for a telecommunication company. Worked on a workforce management system powered by AI. Helped develop a large
          scale identity platform taking advantage of event sourcing patterns. Built out voice assistants and home
          automation integrations to help people keep on top and reduce of their energy usage! And now I am hard at work
          at building out some exciting new features for Xero to really bolster their growth into new markets!
