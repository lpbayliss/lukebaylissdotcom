# What is a Discriminated Union?

Discriminated Unions are a handy feature available to us in TypeScript, they are also known as _Tagged Unions_.

A Discriminated Union type is like many other types, but they include a discriminator property. This discriminator property is most commonly a string literal type that is unique to a particular instance of a type.
Because the discriminator is unique it allows TypeScript to infer precisely what type a variable might be where it might have otherwise been ambiguous.

## A Contrived Example

We have a function that can calculate the area of a shape;

```ts
const calculateShapeArea = (shape: unknown): number => {
  // ... How do we know what type of shape we are dealing with?
};
```

But they way we calculate the area of a circle is not the same as the way we calculate the area of a square. Let's create a few types to represent our shapes;

```ts
type Circle = {
  radius: number;
};

type Rectangle = {
  width: number;
  height: number;
};

type Square = {
  size: number;
};

type Shape = Circle | Rectangle | Square;
```

We can now update our function to use the `Shape` type. We still can't determine what type of shape we are dealing with directly, but with a few checks we can assert the type of shape.

```ts
const calculateShapeArea = (shape: Shape): number => {
  if (shape.radius) {
    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
  } else if (shape.width && shape.height) {
    return shape.width * shape.height;
  } else if (shape.size) {
    return shape.size ** 2;
  }
};
```

This works but it's a little cumbersome. We can improve this by using a Discriminated Union. We will start by adding a `type` property to each of our shapes.

```ts
type Circle = {
  type: "circle";
  radius: number;
};

type Rectangle = {
  type: "rectangle";
  width: number;
  height: number;
};

type Square = {
  type: "square";
  size: number;
};

type Shape = Circle | Rectangle | Square;
```

Now we can use the `type` propertly to determine what type of shape we are dealing with.

```ts
const calculateShapeArea = (shape: Shape): number => {
  switch (shape.type) {
    case "circle":
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case "rectangle":
      return shape.width * shape.height;
    case "square":
      return shape.size ** 2;
  }
};
```

While functionally very simmilar to the previous implementation, it's much easier to see what kinds of shapes our function can handle. A nice added benefit is that our editor can now infer the type of shape we are dealing with and provide us with helpful auto-complete suggestion.

## Using Zod

If you are using Zod to validate your data, you can use Discriminated Unions to make your code even more robust.

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

const CircleSchema = z.object({
  type: z.literal("circle"),
  radius: z.number(),
});

const RectangleSchema = z.object({
  type: z.literal("rectangle"),
  width: z.number(),
  height: z.number(),
});

const SquareSchema = z.object({
  type: z.literal("square"),
  size: z.number(),
});

const ShapeSchema = z.union([Circle, Rectangle, Square]);
type Shape = z.infer<typeof ShapeSchema>;
```
