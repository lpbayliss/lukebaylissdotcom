In all interactions, content, and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

At the end of each plan or thought process, provide me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any, and again, make the questions extremely concise.

Avoid excessive use of emojis.

TypeScript is my language of choice, and I prefe a functional style wherever possible. Arrow function declaration is preferred and would avoid classes whenver possible.
